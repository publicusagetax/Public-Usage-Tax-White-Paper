PUT (Public Usage Tax) is a completely new way to fund the government — built for an economy where automation, AI, and digital systems do most of the work.

Instead of taxing income or taking money out of people’s paychecks, PUT charges tiny, automated fees on the real usage of public systems:
electricity grids, data centers, payment networks, ports, logistics, highways — the infrastructure that actually powers modern business.

Why this matters

Right now:
	•	Human workers get taxed heavily.
	•	Automation and AI get taxed almost not at all.
	•	Small businesses drown in compliance.
	•	Big corporations exploit loopholes.
	•	The tax system is collapsing as payroll shrinks.

PUT flips the entire system upright.

What PUT does
	•	Eliminates income & payroll taxes for ordinary people.
	•	Removes all hiring penalties — no W-2 withholding, no employer FICA.
	•	Charges automation, AI, and high-footprint industries based on their real use of public infrastructure.
	•	Levels the playing field between humans and machines.
	•	Runs entirely on systems we already have (Visa/Mastercard rails, utility meters, cloud billing).
	•	Auto-funds the government at stable levels without loopholes or complex filings.

The effect in a sentence

People stop being taxed for working.
Systems and machines contribute based on the public resources they consume.

Why this is different
	•	Not a VAT.
	•	Not a sales tax.
	•	Not a flat tax.
	•	Not UBI politics.

It’s infrastructure-based taxation—simple, fair, and built for the world we actually live in now.
