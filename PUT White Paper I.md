## SECTION I — The Breakdown of the Legacy Fiscal Architecture

“A tax system is a nation’s moral architecture.  
When it breaks, inequality is not a glitch — it is the design.”  
— Avery Cole

Modern economies were built on a simple architecture: one shared economic loop in which value flowed through labor, capital, and the public systems that supported both. Workers produced income, businesses earned profits, taxes funded infrastructure, and that infrastructure made both workers and firms more productive. Because everything fed back into everything, the loop stayed stable. Rising wages supported demand, demand supported investment, investment supported jobs, and taxes maintained the foundation that kept the entire system coherent.

Over the past four decades, that balance collapsed. Capital did not exit the economy; instead, it created a mini-loop inside the main loop — a closed internal circuit of offshore entities, intangible assets, buybacks, and financial instruments that recirculate value within themselves rather than returning it proportionally to wages or public revenue. The main loop still feeds capital through labor, courts, markets, infrastructure, and consumer demand, but capital now returns far less because a growing share of its gains is diverted into the mini-loop and trapped there. The result is structural imbalance: the main loop weakens while the internal capital loop compounds.

This divergence is not driven by malice. It is the predictable result of competitive incentives embedded in a misaligned fiscal architecture. Firms must minimize costs and maximize returns or risk extinction, and the system rewards routing value through structures that reduce visible income and taxable events. Given those rules, capital followed the rational survival path. But the consequence is a siphon: value that once circulated through wages, taxes, and domestic reinvestment now circulates narrowly and privately. A loop that once reinforced itself now destabilizes.

Automation intensifies this imbalance. As AI, robotics, and digital production expand, the wage-based side of the main loop shrinks while profit flows grow. In an ideal world, this shift would broaden prosperity: once automation produces far more than humans ever could, the cost of sustaining human life becomes a small expense relative to automated output. In principle, automation could subsidize everyone. But viability is not implementation. Under the current tax architecture, there is no mechanism capable of capturing automated gains and redirecting them back into the shared system. The legacy tax base — built on wages and reportable income — cannot reach the value created inside the capital mini-loop. As a result, the tax base collapses long before society can harness automation’s potential to support broad prosperity.

We are left with a fiscal operating system that no longer matches the economy it is meant to govern. The main loop is underfunded. The capital mini-loop compounds. Automation magnifies the imbalance. No adjustment to rates or brackets inside the old architecture can fix what is ultimately a structural design failure.

A new fiscal operating system is required. One that reconnects the trapped value in the capital mini-loop to the shared economy. One that ties contribution to actual reliance on public infrastructure. One that works whether value comes from labor, capital, or automation.

That operating system is the Public Usage Tax (PUT). PUT is a complete fiscal operating system, not just a tax proposal. It governs the full lifecycle of public finance: how revenue is collected, how it is allocated, and how the system stabilizes itself over time. This white paper focuses only on the collection architecture — how PUT rebuilds the tax base by aligning contribution with real economic footprint. The spending, agency-performance, and stabilization components of PUT are part of the full design but lie outside the scope of this document, appearing only where structural context is necessary.

## THE ETHICAL CONSTITUTION OF PUT  
*(Five Mega-Principles)*

To design a fiscal operating system capable of repairing what the legacy architecture broke, we must first define the values that such a system cannot violate. A functioning economy is not just machinery — it is a structure of incentives, protections, and expectations that govern how people and institutions interact.

These principles are not philosophical decoration.  
They are the structural constraints that give PUT coherence, fairness, and durability.

### **1. Dignity of Essentials**  
Essentials required for human life cannot be extraction points. PUT protects baseline participation — food, power, transport, communication, and healthcare — through Tier-1, quantity caps, and privacy-preserving PUV routing.

### **2. Fairness by Footprint**  
Contribution scales only with actual reliance on public systems. Labor, capital, and automation are treated identically: if an activity benefits from public infrastructure, it contributes in proportion to that benefit.

### **3. Incentive Alignment**  
PUT aligns incentives so that choices that benefit individuals also benefit the shared system. When incentives align, the entire economy runs more efficiently.

### **4. Privacy, Autonomy, and Non-Coercion**  
The fiscal system must operate without surveillance, forced reporting, or behavioral logging. PUT functions passively through existing payment rails without intruding on personal autonomy.

### **5. Stewardship and Anti-Waste Efficiency**  
Public systems must minimize waste and maximize clarity. PUT enforces efficiency through rule-based budgeting, outcome-driven renewal, debt elimination, and transparent performance metrics.

## About the PUT White Paper Trilogy

This document is the first in a three-paper series.

- **White Paper I** — Collection Architecture (this paper)  
- **White Paper II** — Allocation & Agency Performance  
- **White Paper III** — Stabilization & Debt Architecture  

Each paper can be read independently, but together they form a complete fiscal operating system.

# SECTION II — Core Principles of PUT’s Collection Architecture

The old system failed because it taxed what could be hidden or reshaped. PUT taxes what cannot be disguised. Contribution follows footprint — the structural strain an activity places on public systems — not income, profit, or legal identity.

## **2.1 — The Footprint Principle**

Every economic action draws from shared infrastructure. Some rely lightly on it; others place heavy strain upon it. The footprint principle measures this load directly. PUT looks at the activity itself: what it is, how it moves through the system, and how much public support it requires.

Footprint is never a profile of a person or company. Two identical actions create the same footprint regardless of who performs them. This is the foundation of fairness: the system taxes the activity, not the identity.

The legacy system made income and legal structure the basis of taxation. PUT replaces both with footprint — the physical and institutional demands an activity places on shared systems, which cannot be hidden or rearranged.

## **2.2 — The Public Infrastructure Substrate**

All private activity depends on a public substrate — energy, transport, data, courts, payments, and the basic institutions that keep the economy coherent. Transactions already carry the metadata that reveal which parts of the substrate they use. PUT reads these signals. It does not require new reporting or new data.

If an activity touches the country’s shared systems, its footprint is visible. And if it uses the substrate, it contributes back to it.

## **2.3 — Tier Integrity**

PUT organizes activity into four tiers: essentials (Tier-1), low-impact (Tier-2), moderate-impact (Tier-3), and high-strain (Tier-4). A sector belongs to a tier because of its footprint, not because of lobbying or legal framing.

High-impact activity cannot be disguised as low-impact activity. Essentials cannot be reclassified to raise revenue. Tier placement changes only when the activity’s footprint changes.

This protects fairness and prevents manipulation that plagued the legacy architecture.

## **2.4 — Footprint-Based Pricing**

A system cannot be fair if the price of an activity has no relation to the strain it places on public systems. PUT restores this link. Low-impact activities pay less; high-impact activities pay more.

Tier-1 essentials receive protection up to monthly household thresholds via the PUV. Beyond the threshold, excess activity shifts to Tier-2 automatically. Protection covers participation, not unlimited consumption.

Income, identity, and legal structure play no role. Only footprint determines contribution.

---

# SECTION III — The PUT Collection Mechanism

## **3.1 — The Transaction Layer**

PUT attaches where every actor intersects with public systems: the payment-rail authorization layer. Nearly all modern activity already passes through this handshake. PUT adds one operation at this moment: classify the activity and return the footprint-based contribution as part of the authorization response.

No new data is collected. No personal information is exposed. No reporting is required.

## **3.2 — Classification and Tier Mapping**

Merchant category codes (MCCs) already classify most of the economy. PUT applies its tier structure to the existing classification system. Where MCCs lack precision, supplemental codes — already used by platforms — provide clarity.

Classification determines the tier. The tier determines the footprint curve. The system does not care who the buyer is or how the seller is structured.

## **3.3 — The Contribution Engine**

Once classification identifies the footprint tier, the contribution engine applies the corresponding point on the contribution curve. This process is instantaneous and embedded in the payment authorization response.

Tier-1 essentials are protected via PUV-enabled monthly caps. The PUV verifies only Tier-1 eligibility and cap status without revealing identity or behavior.

Contribution applies uniformly across labor, capital, and automation. A robot triggering a high-footprint activity incurs the same contribution as a human would.

## **3.4 — Settlement Flow**

PUT settles through the same clearing processes that move interchange and network fees. The contribution does not touch the merchant’s books, does not require remittance, and does not create any year-end reporting obligations.

The PUV never enters settlement. No identity trail is created.

Collection is complete the moment the transaction settles. No backlog. No liabilities. No filings.

A tax system built on settlement — not reporting — cannot be gamed, deferred, or reinterpreted.

---

# SECTION IV — Structural Effects of Footprint-Based Collection

## **4.1 — Neutrality Across Labor, Capital, and Automation**

PUT treats labor, capital, and automation identically. Two actors performing the same activity incur the same contribution. Automation expands the tax base instead of hollowing it out.

Neutrality is structural, not aspirational.

## **4.2 — Non-Regressivity by Design**

Basics required for life are protected via Tier-1 and PUV routing. This protection is structural, not political. No means-testing. No surveillance. No eligibility enforcement.

Footprint is not correlated with income. Essentials remain low-tier. Infrastructure-heavy luxury activity naturally sits at higher tiers. Regressivity cannot re-enter the system.

## **4.3 — Waste Compression and System Efficiency**

PUT eliminates the translation layer of compliance, reporting, and tax engineering. Entire categories of administrative burden simply disappear.

The economy stops spending energy on interpreting itself. Firms compete through efficiency, not avoidance. Public agencies operate on real-time allocation rather than reconstruction of past behavior.

## **4.4 — Stability of the Contribution Curve**

The legacy system relies on reported income — a narrow, manipulable base. PUT relies on footprint — a broad, stable, unavoidable base.

Because PUT taxes extensively rather than intensively, burden is distributed widely and shallowly. No single sector carries fragile dependence. The base expands automatically with real economic activity and automation.

The system remains stable because footprint is stable.

# SECTION V — Implementation, Integrity, and Readiness

## **5.1 — Infrastructure Reuse, Not Expansion**

PUT rides on existing payment rails. No new hardware, sensors, or surveillance systems are needed.

## **5.2 — The Public Usage Voucher (PUV)**

The PUV is not a token or a wallet. It is a routing attribute that protects essentials without revealing identity or behavior. It enforces fairness without building a parallel welfare apparatus.

## **5.3 — Integrity Without Surveillance**

PUT does not track individuals. It does not log behavior. Classification applies only to the good or service at the moment of transaction.

## **5.4 — Compliance by Default**

Because PUT attaches at infrastructure touchpoints, avoidance becomes irrational. There is nothing to file, hide, or reclassify.

## **5.5 — Deployment at National Scale**

National deployment requires updating payment processors, applying the tier schedule, activating PUV routing, and establishing oversight to protect invariants. The heavy machinery already exists.

## **5.6 — Guardrails Against Drift and Capture**

Tier integrity, footprint recalibration rules, and essential protections prevent political or corporate erosion of the system. PUT is not vulnerable to slow distortion because the architecture forbids manipulation without causing systemic failure.

# SECTION VI — The Closed-Loop Architecture & Path to Integration

PUT was designed as a full fiscal operating system composed of three layers:
(1) Collection, (2) Allocation, and (3) Stabilization.
This white paper documents the collection architecture, which is the structural core of PUT.

While PUT’s long-run vision includes the full trilogy, the collection layer is fully functional as a standalone reform. It can be legislated, modeled, implemented, and evaluated independently of the remaining components.

The remaining papers provide the context for full-system performance, but they are not prerequisites for adoption of the collection system itself.

⸻

6.1 — The Collection Circuit

(This paper)

The collection layer rebuilds the tax base by linking contribution to economic footprint and enforcing it automatically through the payment-rail authorization layer.
It does not require:
	•	changes to agency budgeting,
	•	macro stabilization valves,
	•	or downstream spending architecture.

The collection circuit stands alone as a drop-in replacement for income, payroll, and corporate taxes.

⸻

6.2 — The Allocation & Agency-Performance Circuit

(White Paper II — Context, not a dependency)

White Paper II describes how PUT could structure budgeting, agency renewal, and waste-reduction inside a full operating system.
However:

The allocation architecture is optional for adoption of PUT Collection.
Congress may:
	•	retain current budgeting practices,
	•	adopt Collection first,
	•	and explore performance architecture later or not at all.

Collection does not rely on Allocation to function.

⸻

6.3 — The Stabilization Circuit

(White Paper III — Context, not a dependency)

White Paper III describes PUT’s macro-stabilization and debt-management valves.
Again, these mechanisms are not required for PUT Collection to operate.

A government may adopt:
	•	Collection alone,
	•	Collection + Allocation,
	•	or the full three-layer system
depending on political feasibility and institutional appetite.

PUT Collection remains internally stable without the Stabilization Circuit.

⸻

6.4 — Why the Layers Interlock in the Full Vision

In the full PUT architecture:
	•	Collection stabilizes the revenue base.
	•	Allocation stabilizes public-sector performance.
	•	Stabilization neutralizes macroeconomic volatility.

They reinforce one another in the complete system.

But this feedback loop, while beneficial, is not required to deploy the collection layer.
The interlocking design reflects the ideal end state — not a dependency tree.

⸻

6.5 — Adoption Path: Collection First

The collection architecture is the part that can be implemented first, alone, and immediately:
	•	It requires only payment-rail integration, tier mapping, and PUV activation.
	•	It can be scored using today’s BEA input–output tables and consumption data.
	•	It replaces the most fragile elements of the legacy system without touching budgeting or stabilization procedures.
	•	It delivers the largest efficiency and fairness gains with the smallest institutional change.

In short:

PUT Collection is a complete, standalone reform that can be enacted independently, while White Papers II and III offer optional expansions that complete the long-run operating system.
