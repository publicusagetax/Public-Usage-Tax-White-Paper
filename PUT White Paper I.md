SECTION I — The Breakdown of the Legacy Fiscal Architecture

“A tax system is a nation’s moral architecture.
When it breaks, inequality is not a glitch — it is the design.”
— Avery Cole

Modern economies were built on a simple architecture: one shared economic loop in which value flowed through labor, capital, and the public systems that supported both. Workers produced income, businesses earned profits, taxes funded infrastructure, and that infrastructure made both workers and firms more productive. Because everything fed back into everything, the loop stayed stable. Rising wages supported demand, demand supported investment, investment supported jobs, and taxes maintained the foundation that kept the entire system coherent.

Over the past four decades, that balance collapsed. Capital did not exit the economy; instead, it created a mini-loop inside the main loop—a closed internal circuit of offshore entities, intangible assets, buybacks, and financial instruments that recirculate value within themselves rather than returning it proportionally to wages or public revenue. The main loop still feeds capital through labor, courts, markets, infrastructure, and consumer demand, but capital now returns far less because a growing share of its gains is diverted into the mini-loop and trapped there. The result is structural imbalance: the main loop weakens while the internal capital loop compounds.

This divergence is not driven by malice. It is the predictable result of competitive incentives embedded in a misaligned fiscal architecture. Firms must minimize costs and maximize returns or risk extinction, and the system rewards routing value through structures that reduce visible income and taxable events. Given those rules, capital followed the rational survival path. But the consequence is a siphon: value that once circulated through wages, taxes, and domestic reinvestment now circulates narrowly and privately. A loop that once reinforced itself now destabilizes.

Automation intensifies this imbalance. As AI, robotics, and digital production expand, the wage-based side of the main loop shrinks while profit flows grow. In an ideal world, this shift would broaden prosperity: once automation produces far more than humans ever could, the cost of sustaining human life becomes a small expense relative to automated output. In principle, automation could subsidize everyone. But viability is not implementation. Under the current tax architecture, there is no mechanism capable of capturing automated gains and redirecting them back into the shared system. The legacy tax base—built on wages and reportable income—cannot reach the value created inside the capital mini-loop. As a result, the tax base collapses long before society can harness automation’s potential to support broad prosperity.

We are left with a fiscal operating system that no longer matches the economy it is meant to govern. The main loop is underfunded. The capital mini-loop compounds. Automation magnifies the imbalance. No adjustment to rates or brackets inside the old architecture can fix what is ultimately a structural design failure.

A new fiscal operating system is required. One that reconnects the trapped value in the capital mini-loop to the shared economy. One that ties contribution to actual reliance on public infrastructure. One that works whether value comes from labor, capital, or automation.

That operating system is the Public Usage Tax (PUT). PUT is a complete fiscal operating system, not just a tax proposal. It governs the full lifecycle of public finance: how revenue is collected, how it is allocated, and how the system stabilizes itself over time. This white paper focuses only on the collection architecture—how PUT rebuilds the tax base by aligning contribution with real economic footprint. The spending, agency-performance, and stabilization components of PUT are part of the full design but lie outside the scope of this document, appearing only where structural context is necessary.

⸻

To design a fiscal operating system capable of repairing what the legacy architecture broke, we must first define the values that such a system cannot violate.
A functioning economy is not just machinery — it is a structure of incentives, protections, and expectations that govern how people and institutions interact.

Before the mechanics of PUT are introduced, the ethical constitution of the system must be stated clearly and without ambiguity.
These principles are not philosophical decoration.
They are the structural constraints that give PUT coherence, enforce its fairness, and prevent the distortions that destroyed the old architecture.

What follows are the five principles that any viable, future-proof fiscal system must obey.

THE ETHICAL CONSTITUTION OF PUT

(Five Mega-Principles)

1. Dignity of Essentials

Essentials required for human life cannot be extraction points. PUT protects baseline participation — food, power, transport, communication, and healthcare — through Tier-1, quantity caps, and privacy-preserving PUV routing.

2. Fairness by Footprint

Contribution scales only with actual reliance on public systems. Labor, capital, and automation are treated identically: if an activity benefits from public infrastructure, it contributes in proportion to that benefit.

3. Incentive Alignment

When we are all in alignment, the entire system runs more efficiently.
PUT aligns incentives so that choices that benefit individuals also benefit the shared system, and extractive or harmful behaviors become economically unattractive.

4. Privacy, Autonomy, and Non-Coercion

The fiscal system must operate without surveillance, forced reporting, behavioral logging, or administrative burdens. People and businesses retain full autonomy; PUT functions passively through existing payment rails.

5. Stewardship and Anti-Waste Efficiency

Public systems must minimize waste, maximize clarity, and operate with intergenerational responsibility. PUT enforces efficiency through rule-based budgeting, performance accountability, stabilization valves, and the elimination of debt-driven extraction.

About the PUT White Paper Trilogy

This document is the first in a three-paper series.
White Paper I establishes the collection architecture — the structural base on which the entire fiscal operating system depends.
White Paper II details the allocation and agency-performance framework, where spending, outcomes, and public-sector efficiency are governed without political discretion.
White Paper III presents PUT’s stabilization engine — the debt dynamics, the Stabilization Fund, the macro-valves, and the liquidity architecture that make the system self-correcting.

Each paper can be read independently, but together they form a coherent operating system.
This paper begins where any viable fiscal architecture must begin: the foundation of collection.

SECTION II — Core Principles of PUT’s Collection Architecture

The old system failed because it taxed what could be hidden or reshaped. PUT is built on the opposite idea: it taxes what cannot be disguised. Instead of relying on income, profit, or legal structure, PUT ties contribution to the footprint an activity leaves on public systems. This is what makes the tax base stable. It cannot be eroded by clever structuring because it does not depend on categories that can be changed.

2.1 — The Footprint Principle

Every economic action draws from shared infrastructure. Some rely lightly on it; others place a heavy load. The footprint principle measures this load directly. PUT looks at the activity itself — what it is, how it moves through the system, and how much public support it requires.

Footprint is not a profile of a person or a company. It is not about who you are. It is the structure of the activity. Two identical actions create the same footprint even if performed by different actors. This is the foundation of fairness in PUT: the system treats the action, not the identity.

The legacy system made income and legal structure the basis of taxation. PUT replaces both with something that cannot be hidden or rearranged. Footprint is the economic reality underneath whatever form an entity chooses to take.


2.2 — The Public Infrastructure Substrate

All private activity depends on a public substrate: energy, transport, data, courts, payments, and the basic institutions that keep the economy coherent. This substrate is the real platform on which the economy runs. PUT makes it visible.

Transactions already carry the signals that reveal which parts of the substrate they use — merchant type, transaction form, settlement rails. PUT reads these signals. It does not require new reporting, new data, or any form of tracking. The system knows what it needs to know because the infrastructure already emits the structure of the activity.

This is why PUT cannot be avoided by moving entities offshore or reshuffling profit. As long as an activity touches the public substrate, its footprint is visible. If an action uses the country’s shared systems, it contributes back to them. The connection is automatic.


2.3 — Tier Integrity

To reflect real differences in footprint, PUT organizes activity into four structural tiers. Essentials occupy Tier-1 and receive strong protection. Low-impact activity sits in Tier-2, moderate-impact activity in Tier-3, and high-strain activity in Tier-4.

The integrity of these tiers is what makes the system resistant to distortion. A sector belongs to a tier because of its footprint, not because of lobbying or legal framing. High-impact activity cannot be disguised as low-impact activity. Essentials cannot be reclassified to raise revenue. A tier changes only if the footprint of the activity itself changes.

Tier integrity protects fairness. It also protects the stability of the tax base. When footprint determines contribution and the tiers cannot be manipulated, the system cannot be hollowed out by those with the resources to reshape their identity under the old rules.

2.4 — Footprint-Based Pricing

A tax system cannot stay fair or stable if the price of an activity has no relation to the strain it places on shared systems. Under the legacy architecture, that link broke. Activities that relied heavily on public infrastructure often paid less than activities that relied lightly on it, simply because income could be shifted, profits could be deferred, or entities could be restructured. PUT restores that link by tying price directly to footprint.

The contribution curve is simple. Low-impact activities pay less because they draw lightly on the public substrate. High-impact activities pay more because they depend on energy, transport, data, logistics, courts, and institutional support at a scale that creates real costs for everyone else. Essentials are shielded at the household level: basic groceries and other Tier-1 items remain protected even when the underlying sectors are capital-intensive. PUT prices the footprint of the activity, not the balance sheet behind it.

Pricing does not come from annual negotiation or ad-hoc exemptions. It comes from the structural properties of the activity itself. How much energy does it use? How far does it move? How much infrastructure does it occupy? How much enforcement and coordination does it rely on? These features determine the tier, and the tier determines the rate. The same activity always generates the same contribution, regardless of who performs it or which legal structure they choose.

Because footprint, not income, sets the burden, the system treats labor, capital, and automation identically. A robot performing a high-impact task sits on the same contribution curve as a worker performing the same task. A large platform and a small firm drawing on the same high-impact infrastructure face the same structural price. The rate follows the strain on shared systems, not the story told about where the money came from.

This makes the tax base durable. It does not shrink when reported income shrinks. It does not collapse when legal structures change. It is anchored to the physical and institutional reality of how the economy uses public systems. The activity can move. The paperwork can move. The footprint cannot.

SECTION III — The PUT Collection Mechanism

3.1 — The Transaction Layer

PUT attaches at the one point in the economy where every actor—households, firms, platforms, and automated systems—intersects with public infrastructure: the payment-rail authorization layer. Nearly all modern economic activity already passes through this handshake between issuer, network, and merchant. That moment carries everything needed for classification: the merchant identity, the activity code, the transaction amount, and the routing metadata that determines how the payment is processed.

The legacy system never operated here because it was built for a world where economic activity could be reconstructed through annual reporting. Once value began flowing through digital platforms, cross-border entities, and automated systems, that assumption collapsed. PUT eliminates the reporting layer entirely. Contribution does not depend on disclosure, paperwork, or audit; it is determined mechanically at the moment the transaction is authorized.

During authorization, the system performs a single added operation: it classifies the transaction according to its footprint and returns the appropriate contribution amount as part of the authorization response. No additional data is collected, and no personal information is exposed. PUT uses only the signals already required by the rails to process the payment. The contribution is calculated instantly and settles in the same way network and interchange fees have settled for decades.

Operating at the transaction layer makes PUT structurally different from every legacy tax. There are no filings, no quarterly estimates, no withholding, and no opportunity to shift income or disguise activity through legal structure. The rails do not care who the actor is. They only see the activity. PUT anchors itself there—at the one point in the economy where the footprint is visible and cannot be reinterpreted.

3.2 — Classification and Tier Mapping

Once a transaction reaches the authorization layer, PUT needs only one piece of information to classify it: what the activity is. The modern payment system already answers this through merchant category codes and related routing metadata. Every transaction that moves through a card network, digital wallet, or platform processor carries a standardized activity identifier because the rails themselves require it to determine how the payment should be handled.

PUT uses this existing structure rather than creating a new one. Merchant category codes provide the baseline classification for most of the economy: groceries, utilities, transportation, logistics, construction, hospitality, professional services, fuel, healthcare, digital services, and thousands of other activities already map cleanly to a code. For categories where MCC precision is insufficient, supplemental classification codes—also already used in platform and commercial processing—fill the gap. PUT does not invent a new ontology; it applies a tier structure to the one the economy already uses.

This is where the principles from Section 2 align with the mechanics. The classification does not determine the rate; it determines the footprint tier. The tier then determines where on the contribution curve the activity sits. Essentials remain Tier-1 for households regardless of the underlying sector’s capital intensity. Services and goods with modest infrastructure strain fall naturally into Tier-2. Capital-heavy, energy-intensive, or logistics-dense activities sit in Tier-3 or Tier-4. The classification step simply ensures that the activity is correctly mapped to its structural footprint.

Because classification is tied to merchant identity and activity type—not the attributes of the buyer—there is no way to manipulate the tier through legal structuring. A transaction for fuel is still fuel. A payment to a data center is still a payment to a data center. High-impact activities cannot be disguised as low-impact ones without falsifying the underlying merchant identity, which the rails do not permit. Classification is mechanical, not discretionary.

This ensures neutrality. Two firms performing the same activity face the same tier. Two individuals purchasing the same service face the same tier. Automation and labor face the same tier. PUT does not ask who the actor is; it classifies only the activity, and the activity does not change its nature because the participant does.

3.3 — The Contribution Engine

Once a transaction is classified, the contribution engine determines the appropriate rate. This step is mechanical, not discretionary. PUT does not ask who the buyer is, how much income they earn, or what legal structure the seller uses. It applies a single rule: price follows footprint. Classification identifies the footprint tier; the contribution engine applies the corresponding point on the contribution curve.

For most transactions, this step is instantaneous. The authorization request arrives with the merchant identity, activity code, and transaction amount. The system returns the PUT amount as part of the same authorization response. The rails already support this pattern; network and interchange fees operate the same way. PUT simply adds one structural operation—the footprint-based contribution—to a flow the financial system has executed for decades.

Tier-1 essentials introduce one additional layer: baseline protection. Essentials required for human participation in modern life—basic groceries, utilities, fuel, essential healthcare, public transportation, and baseline digital access—receive Tier-1 treatment up to a monthly household threshold. Beyond that threshold, the transaction shifts to Tier-2 automatically. This ensures the system protects necessities without enabling unlimited low-tier consumption.

The enforcement of caps does not require tracking, reporting, or behavioral logs. Quantity caps operate through the same monthly counters that already support subscription billing, rewards, prepaid balances, and usage-limited commercial services. When a Tier-1 transaction is authorized, the rails check whether the household has remaining Tier-1 capacity. If so, the Tier-1 rate applies. If not, the authorization returns the Tier-2 rate. No personal data enters the contribution flow; only a yes/no Tier-1 eligibility flag is used, carried through the PUV during authorization.

The Public Usage Voucher (PUV) enables this without exposing identity. It verifies only Tier-1 eligibility and cap status. It does not reveal who the household is, how much they purchase, or any behavioral information. The PUV exists solely to preserve fairness: households receive the protection they are entitled to without the system needing to know anything else about them.

Once the tier and cap status are known, the contribution engine applies the footprint-based rate. Low-impact activities incur low contributions; high-impact activities incur higher ones. The result is a uniform rule that treats labor, capital, and automation identically. A robot purchasing fuel draws down the same Tier-2 or Tier-3 capacity as a human. A data center’s energy purchases sit naturally on the upper tiers. A household’s grocery purchases remain protected at Tier-1.

The contribution engine completes the collection loop. It converts classification into contribution through a mechanical, auditable, and non-manipulable process, operating entirely within the infrastructure the economy already uses. There are no filings. No withholding. No reconstructing the past. PUT settles the public contribution at the moment the activity touches the public substrate, and the activity cannot be relabeled to escape it.

3.4 — Settlement Flow

Once the contribution amount is calculated, PUT follows the same settlement pathways already used by the payment networks. Nothing new is invented. Nothing is bolted on. The contribution settles alongside the transaction in the same batch process that moves interchange fees, network fees, and merchant settlements every single day.

When the authorization response returns the PUT contribution, the rails allocate it to a designated Treasury account as part of the clearing process. The contribution never touches the merchant’s books, never appears as income, and never requires reconciliation. It is not a withholding. It is not a remittance obligation. It is a parallel settlement line item handled entirely by the networks that already clear trillions of dollars in transactions with near-perfect reliability.

Because PUT rides on top of existing settlement architecture, it inherits the system’s strengths: standardized formatting, predictable timing, global compatibility, and hardened security. There is no need for new reporting requirements because the contribution is not a reportable event; it is a real-time charge embedded in the transaction itself. The merchant sees the gross amount, the PUT amount, and the net amount, just as they see interchange or network fees. For households and businesses, the process is invisible. There is no compliance burden to absorb because there is nothing to file.

Crucially, no personal data accompanies the settlement. The rails transmit only what is required to reconcile the transaction: merchant ID, transaction amount, classification code, and the PUT amount. The PUV never enters the settlement layer. It does not follow the transaction. It does not become part of a ledger. Its role ends at authorization, ensuring that Tier-1 protections remain private and cannot be reverse-engineered.

This completes the collection loop. PUT observes the activity at authorization, classifies it mechanically, applies the footprint-based contribution, and settles the amount through existing clearing processes. By the time the transaction reaches the merchant’s account, public contribution has already been delivered to the Treasury. No backlog accumulates. No liability builds. No one owes anything after the fact. Collection is contemporaneous with the economic activity itself.

A tax system built on settlement rather than reporting cannot be gamed, deferred, or reinterpreted. It cannot be eroded through legal structuring. It cannot collapse under automation or digital value flows. PUT closes the collection circuit at the point where activity meets infrastructure and leaves no gaps behind it.

SECTION IV — Structural Effects of Footprint-Based Collection

4.1 — Neutrality Across Labor, Capital, and Automation

A tax system is only as stable as the base it rests on. The legacy architecture rested on income, a variable that can be hidden, shifted, deferred, reclassified, or eliminated by automation. As labor’s share of production falls, the base collapses. PUT removes the dependence on income entirely. By tying contribution to footprint—the strain an activity places on shared public systems—the system remains neutral across all forms of production, whether performed by people, firms, platforms, or autonomous systems.

Under PUT, labor and capital are not adversarial categories; they are simply different methods of generating activity. If two actors perform the same footprint-heavy activity, both incur the same contribution, even if one is a worker, one is a corporation, and one is a robotic system executing code. PUT does not rely on wages, profit declarations, or reported income. It measures the activity, not the actor.

This neutrality eliminates the incentive distortions that defined the legacy architecture. Firms no longer benefit from replacing workers simply to reduce payroll taxes. Legal structures no longer determine tax treatment. Profit-shifting does not affect contribution because contribution follows the physical and institutional demand the activity places on public infrastructure. Offshore entities still depend on U.S. data, energy, and logistics systems; under PUT, that dependence generates the same obligation as it would for a domestic firm.

Automation strengthens the base instead of hollowing it. As automated systems expand output, the footprint they generate scales with them. An AI system that processes transactions, routes data, or manages logistics uses public systems just as a human-operated system would. Under the legacy model, rising automation shrinks the tax base. Under PUT, rising automation expands it.

Neutrality is not a philosophical goal; it is the structural requirement for any tax system meant to survive the 21st-century economy. PUT achieves neutrality by design, not through corrective exemptions or administrative adjustments. It treats equal activities equally because it rests on the only measure that remains stable as the economy evolves: the footprint the activity imposes on the shared systems underlying modern life.

4.2 — Non-Regressivity by Design

A tax system cannot be fair if it penalizes participation in basic life. The legacy architecture failed this test. By tying contribution to income, it created a structure where households with modest earnings often paid a higher effective burden than corporations capable of shifting profits or reclassifying income. Flat consumption taxes fare no better; they extract the most from those with the least flexibility.

PUT avoids regressivity not by policy choices or targeted exemptions, but by design. Essentials required for modern life—basic groceries, utilities, transportation fuel, essential healthcare, public transport, and baseline digital access—are structurally protected at Tier-1. Households receive these protections automatically through the PUV, which verifies Tier-1 eligibility without revealing identity or tracking behavior. Tier-1 treatment applies only to the portion of consumption that constitutes participation in society; usage above that threshold naturally moves to Tier-2.

This ensures fairness without surveillance. No agency needs to determine who “deserves” protection. No reporting is required. No means-testing is performed. The system protects essentials because essentials are not extraction points; they are the foundation on which participation rests.

Regressivity does not arise from the footprint-based tiers because footprint is not correlated with income. A household buying groceries draws lightly on public systems regardless of wealth. A luxury data center draws heavily regardless of the accountant behind it. Activities with small infrastructure strain sit naturally on the lower tiers. Activities that impose heavy strain sit naturally on the upper tiers. The economic identity of the buyer does not distort this logic.

Because the tiers follow structural reality rather than discretionary judgment, regressivity cannot re-enter through political pressure. Tier-1 cannot be collapsed into higher tiers because the architecture forbids extracting revenue from basic participation. Tier-3 and Tier-4 cannot be pushed downward because their footprint does not change. And income—volatile, manipulable, and increasingly decoupled from production—plays no role.

Non-regressivity is not a corrective measure layered on top of PUT. It is a property of tying contribution to the strain an activity places on the systems everyone depends on. When fairness emerges from architecture rather than policy, it remains stable across administrations and economic cycles.

4.3 — Waste Compression and System Efficiency

The legacy tax architecture carries an invisible cost that compounds through every part of the economy: the cost of interpreting, reporting, defending, and navigating the tax code itself. Every hour spent reconstructing past activity, complying with reporting rules, or engineering around structural gaps is an hour not spent on production. When a tax system requires the economy to continuously translate itself, the translation becomes a shadow economy of its own.

PUT eliminates this translation layer. Because contribution is determined mechanically at the transaction layer, there is nothing to report, nothing to reconcile, and nothing to defend after the fact. The activities that once required accountants, compliance departments, and legal structures simply disappear from the system’s operational surface. The public does not file. Businesses do not reconstruct. Agencies do not audit normal activity because the contribution is settled before the activity completes.

This compression of waste is not marginal. Entire categories of complexity—payroll withholding, quarterly estimated payments, year-end reconciliation, income attribution, entity classification, profit shifting, and structural tax planning—dissolve once contribution is tied to footprint rather than declared income. The labor that once maintained compliance infrastructures is returned to productive work. Firms that competed through tax engineering now compete through efficiency. The administrative load on government shrinks because the system no longer relies on retroactive reconstruction of economic behavior.

PUT also removes the incentive to route activity through structures designed to minimize visibility. When contribution follows footprint rather than accounting identity, there is no advantage to shifting value offshore, deferring profits, or moving transactions through entities that exist solely for tax positioning. The system closes the gaps not through enforcement but through architecture. If an activity draws on U.S. infrastructure, it generates a contribution proportional to its strain, regardless of where the associated balance sheet resides.

Efficiency is a byproduct of structural alignment. When the measurement of activity occurs where the activity happens, and when contribution settles alongside the transaction itself, the friction born of interpretation disappears. The economy moves without dragging a compliance engine behind it. The public sector receives revenue without reconstructing the past. And the system no longer rewards those who avoid contribution through complexity, but those who reduce footprint through genuine innovation.

4.4 — Stability of the Contribution Curve

A fiscal system is only as stable as the base it relies on. The legacy architecture rests on reported income—a narrow, volatile, and increasingly artificial variable. Income can be deferred, hidden, reclassified, or eliminated through automation. When the base shrinks, the system becomes fragile. PUT avoids this instability entirely by anchoring contribution to footprint, the one measure of activity that remains constant across technological and structural change.

Footprint is stable because the public substrate is stable. Energy flows, data flows, logistics networks, transportation systems, and digital infrastructure are used continuously and predictably, regardless of how wages or profits are declared. As the economy grows, footprint grows with it. As automation expands, the footprint of automated systems expands alongside. Under PUT, the tax base does not erode when income classifications shift; it follows the physical and institutional demand placed on shared systems, which cannot be disguised or relocated.

This stability is reinforced by how the system distributes the burden. PUT taxes extensively rather than intensively. Instead of concentrating revenue on a narrow class of taxpayers or a limited set of reportable events, it collects millions of small contributions across the entire economic substrate. No single sector, legal structure, or demographic carries a disproportionate share. A broad, shallow contribution geometry is inherently more resilient than a narrow base with steep rates. Shocks to any one category cannot destabilize revenue because the system does not depend on any one category.

Tier integrity ensures that this distribution reflects structural reality rather than political negotiation. High-impact activities remain high-impact regardless of who performs them or how they are structured; low-impact activities remain low-impact regardless of income or wealth. Actors cannot migrate themselves into lower tiers without genuinely reducing their footprint. Contribution cannot be engineered away because footprint cannot be engineered away.

This architecture produces predictable revenue without requiring constant policy adjustments. When activity contracts, contributions contract proportionally, releasing pressure on households and firms without imposing instability on public funding. When activity expands, the base expands automatically. The system does not rely on administrative discretion to maintain fairness or adequacy; the curve stabilizes itself because it follows the underlying structure of the economy.

Stability emerges not from enforcement or legislative tuning, but from design. A contribution curve grounded in footprint—broad, shallow, continuous, and non-manipulable—remains aligned with economic reality across cycles, across technologies, and across shifts in the composition of production. It is the only base durable enough to support a modern fiscal system.

SECTION V — Implementation, Integrity, and Readiness of the Collection Layer

A tax architecture is only as strong as its implementability. A system may be theoretically sound, ethically coherent, and economically stabilizing, but if it requires new hardware, new agencies, or new surveillance mechanisms, it collapses under its own weight. PUT avoids this failure by design. The collection layer is fully deployable on existing payment rails, requires no behavioral reporting, and needs no new monitoring infrastructure. The system operates because the economic substrate already contains everything necessary for implementation.

5.1 — Infrastructure Reuse, Not Infrastructure Expansion

PUT does not create new choke points or new administrative machinery. It rides on the rails that already move value through the economy: card networks, banking protocols, settlement layers, and digital transaction systems. These rails already verify identity, timestamp events, settle payments, and route funds. PUT adds only a minimal rule-set and tier verification logic to this existing machinery, transforming what is currently a passive network into an active conduit of fiscal contribution.  
No sensors. No IoT. No government tracking systems. No new hardware. The modern economy is already instrumented; PUT simply aligns fiscal logic with that reality.

5.2 — The Role of the Public Usage Voucher (PUV)

PUV is the verification mechanism that ensures Tier-1 protections remain universal, privacy-safe, and non-coercive. It is not a token, not a wallet, not a traceable ledger. It is a routing flag—an identity-level attribute that payment systems use to apply caps, protections, and fairness constraints. PUV ensures essential goods remain universally accessible without building a parallel welfare system or creating administrative friction.  
By leveraging the existing identity layer in payment networks, PUV preserves dignity without requiring disclosure. It is the minimal tool necessary to enforce non-regressivity inside a footprint-based architecture.

5.3 — Integrity Without Surveillance

PUT separates measurement from monitoring. Footprint is never individually tracked. No one’s behavior is recorded. No logs of movement, location, or consumption patterns are created. Instead, the tier classification applies only to the good or service at the moment of transaction.  
This preserves the autonomy and privacy of individuals while ensuring that contribution reflects real system reliance. PUT’s integrity does not depend on auditing citizens; it depends on the invariants of the economic landscape.

5.4 — Compliance by Default

The legacy system relies on enforcement. PUT relies on structure. Because contribution occurs at the point where value touches a public system—and because those touchpoints already run through formal payment channels—compliance becomes the natural state. Avoidance becomes economically irrational.  
There are no forms to file, no income categories to redefine, no profit classifications to manipulate. The collection layer becomes invisible. As long as people participate in the modern economy, they participate in the system.

5.5 — Deployment at National Scale

A system of this scope must be stable at full scale. PUT meets this requirement because:
- it is agnostic to legal structure;  
- it is compatible with all forms of economic activity;  
- it scales automatically as digital and automated systems expand;  
- it avoids the brittle choke points that make legacy taxes sink under complexity.

National deployment is primarily a matter of updating payment processors, applying the tier schedule, activating PUV routing, and establishing oversight to ensure invariants are preserved. The heavy machinery of collection is already built; PUT merely updates the operating rules.

5.6 — Guardrails Against Drift and Capture

A fiscal architecture is vulnerable not because of its mechanics, but because of the ability of powerful actors to reshape it over time. PUT addresses this risk structurally. The tier system is protected by the Tier Integrity Guardrail (TIG). Footprint coefficients are governed by the Dynamic Footprint Recalibration & Automatic Rate Realignment Rule (DFR/ARR). Essentials are protected by the Baseline Priority Rule (BPR). These guardrails ensure that political pressure cannot distort the core logic without breaking the system outright.  
PUT is immune to slow erosion because the cost of tampering is systemic collapse, not mere inefficiency.

⸻

The collection layer of PUT is implementable today, on the infrastructure that already exists, with the transparency and simplicity that the legacy system lacks. This section demonstrates that the architecture is not only coherent but deployable, and that its integrity is preserved through design rather than enforcement. The next section illustrates how these properties interact to create a stable, predictable fiscal foundation capable of supporting a modern economy.

SECTION VI — The Closed-Loop Architecture & Path to Integration

A fiscal operating system is only complete when collection, allocation, and stabilization reinforce one another. PUT’s collection layer—defined in this paper—rebuilds the tax base by aligning contribution with footprint. But a closed-loop architecture emerges only when the remaining two layers are attached: the spending and agency-performance architecture, and the stabilization architecture that governs liquidity, downturn response, and debt dynamics.

This paper has focused exclusively on the collection layer because it is the foundation on which the others depend. Without a stable, fair, and manipulation-resistant revenue base, no allocation rule can sustain legitimacy and no stabilization mechanism can remain solvent. PUT’s footprint-based base provides the constant input that makes the rest of the system possible.

In the full architecture, revenue flows through three circuits:

1. **The Collection Circuit**  
   Defined here. Contribution is determined by economic footprint and captured passively at the moment activity touches public systems.

2. **The Allocation & Agency-Performance Circuit**  
   Detailed in White Paper II.  
   This layer governs how funds are distributed, how agencies are evaluated, how rollover incentives reinforce efficiency, and how waste is structurally eliminated through outcome-based renewal. It ensures public spending remains aligned with public benefit.

3. **The Stabilization Circuit**  
   Detailed in White Paper III.  
   This layer governs the Stabilization Fund and the Debt Pay-Down Fund (and, after national debt is retired, the NRIT). These fiscal valves neutralize inflation and deflation, eliminating the cyclical fragility that defines the legacy system. This is where PUT becomes a modern macro-stabilizer rather than a tax reform.

Only when these three circuits interact does the system achieve self-correction.  
Contribution flows to allocation, allocation flows to outcomes, and outcomes feed back into the stability of the collection curve. The loops reinforce one another without burdensome administration or discretionary policymaking.

A true fiscal operating system must not rely on guesswork, enforcement, or political cycles to remain coherent. It must remain stable because its structure makes instability impossible. PUT achieves this only when the three components form a closed loop.

This paper has established the first component: the collection architecture that makes the rest of the system viable. The next two papers complete the loop. Together, the trilogy documents a fiscal system designed for an economy where labor, capital, and automation coexist—and where prosperity becomes structural, not accidental.
Even though PUT is designed as a unified, closed-loop architecture, nothing prevents partial adoption. In practice, legislatures may implement the collection layer first, simply because it is the most mechanical, least discretionary component and because it solves an urgent problem on its own: the collapse of the wage-based tax base. A footprint-anchored, transaction-layer collection system stabilizes revenue immediately, even without the allocation and stabilization circuits attached. In that scenario, the remaining circuits operate as optional upgrades that can be added when political or fiscal conditions allow.

This does not diminish the coherence of the full architecture; it only acknowledges the sequencing reality common to every major tax transition in modern history. PUT’s collection layer is structurally strong enough to stand alone until the political system is ready to complete the loop.
